  <h2>Business Skills 360 Podcast</h2>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Hello, and welcome back to the skills 360 podcast. I'm your host, Tim Simmons.</p>
  <p>And today, I want to talk about <strong>how you can sound <u>more credible</u> or believable.</strong></p>
  <p>In our last lesson, we look that what you should say to sound credible. In this lesson, we're going to take
  a look at what not to say. In other words, there something that can damage your crediblity. These are habit or expressions
  that will people trust you less, not more. One thing that makes you sound less credible is <i>"talking about yourself</i> too much."
  The words "I", and "me" are dangerous if you use theme too much.
  Boasting about what you've done and what you know, or who you know, what make most people trust you more?
  Alright. In my work for some polititions with some listeners, but for the most part, talking at link about how great you are
  is not a good idea.</p> <p>Another thing to avoid is <i>"Exeggeratioin".</i> If your company earned eight hundred thousand dollars,
  don't say, "We've made millions of dollars." And if there have been a few doesn't complaints, don't say there have been
  hundreds or thousands of complaints. Just be straight up with people. Tell theme the truth. Then explane why it matters.
  Exaggerating and emotional effect does not make you sound more credible.</p>
