      You walked in
      Caught my attention
      I've never seen
      A man with so much dimension

      It's the way you walk
      The way you talk
      The way you make me feel inside
      It's in your smile
      It's in your eyes
      I don't wanna wait for tonight

      So I want daydreamin'
      With my chin in the palm of my hands
      About you
      You and only you
      Got me daydreaming
      With my chin in the palm of my hands
      About you
      You and only you

      For you oh oh oh ohh
      For you oh oh oh ohh
      For you oh oh oh ohh
      For you oh oh ohh

      Now I can't wait
      To hold you in my arms
      I know I was made for you
      I'm in love with all your charm

      It's the way you walk
      The way you talk
      The way you make me feel inside
      It's in your smile
      It's in your eyes
      I don't wanna wait for tonight

      So I want daydreamin'
      With my chin in the palm of my hands
      About you
      You and only you
      Got me daydreaming
      With my chin in the palm of my hands
      About you
      You and only you

      And I want you
      Got to have you
      And I need you
      Like I never have
      Loved before

      Oh I want you
      Oh I need you
      Got to have you
      Like I never have
      Loved before
